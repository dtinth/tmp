# tmp.spacet.me

[**tmp.spacet.me**](https://tmp.spacet.me/) is a web-based local file storage application. Basically, you can put files into it, and you can get files out of it. It aims to support every possible methods that browsers allow web apps to work with files.

It also comes with an **extensions system**. Users can add extensions to enhance the functionalities of the app.

For example, the [tmp-webrtc](https://tmp-docs.spacet.me/tmp-webrtc.html) extension lets me send files from one device to another using peer-to-peer technology WebRTC.

The [tmp-photopea](https://tmp-docs.spacet.me/tmp-photopea.html) extension lets me edit image files in Photopea.

Users can build their own extensions to suit their needs.

For example, I built an extension to upload images to my static file hosting.
